Making sure the cpu's frequency doesn't scale during the speedtest:

sudo pstate-frequency -S --turbo off	# turn off frequency scaling
sudo pstate-frequency -S --min 100	# set frequency of cpu cores to 100% (base frequency)
sudo pstate-frequency -S --max 100

pstate-frequency -G			# to check if turbo is off and the percentages are properly set to around 100% (the cpu frequencies reported here can be misleading)
cpufreq-info				# check the actual cpu core frequencies, should be around the base frequency
